**Data Story**

The UK housing market is a dynamic and complex system that has experienced significant changes over the past few decades. The "price_paid_records.csv" dataset provides a comprehensive source of information about property sales in the UK, covering a period from 1995 to 2021. By analyzing this dataset, we can gain valuable insights into the UK housing market, including trends in property prices and factors that influence housing demand and supply.

The "price_paid_records.csv" dataset includes data on over 25 million property transactions in the UK, making it one of the largest and most comprehensive sources of information about UK housing prices. The dataset contains 11 variables, including the transaction unique identifier, price, date of transfer, property type, old/new, duration, town/city, district, county, PPDCategory type, and record status (monthly file only).

Trends in Property Prices:
Analyzing the data by year, we can see that property prices have generally increased over the past two decades, with a significant spike in prices in the mid-2000s followed by a dip during the financial crisis of 2008. Since then, prices have generally continued to rise, although there has been some variation depending on location and property type. This trend indicates a growing demand for housing in the UK, which could be driven by factors such as population growth, economic growth, and changes in household demographics.

Factors Affecting Property Prices:
Apart from the overall trend in property prices, several factors influence housing demand and supply. By analyzing the data by location and property type, we can identify patterns in the factors that influence prices. For instance, we might find that properties located in urban areas tend to have higher prices than those in rural areas, or that detached houses tend to be more expensive than flats or terraced houses. Additionally, we might find that factors such as the age of the property, the duration of the lease, and other relevant details also impact property prices. These insights provide policymakers and stakeholders with a better understanding of the UK housing market and can inform decisions around housing supply and policy.

Implications for the UK Housing Market:
Based on the insights gained from the data, we can draw some conclusions about the UK housing market. For example, we might identify areas where property prices are rising rapidly and where demand for housing is high. Alternatively, we might identify areas where property prices are stagnant or declining, which could indicate a lack of demand or oversupply. By understanding these trends and patterns, policymakers, investors, and other stakeholders can make more informed decisions about the UK housing market.


**Exploratory Data Analysis**

*First Thing First: Load Libraries*

```{r}
# Load the tidyverse package for data manipulation and visualization
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

#More libraries are provided in the code as required
```


*Step-1: Load Dataset into R Markdown*

```{r}
library(data.table)

price_paid_records <- fread("D:\\stirling\\Semester 2\\hussain\\amin\\price_paid_records.csv")

#price_paid_records <- read_csv(file="D:\\stirling\\Semester 2\\hussain\\amin\\price_paid_records.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)

ggplot(data = price_paid_records, aes(x = Price)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  labs(x = "Price", y = "Count", title = "Histogram of Property Prices")

```
I am having difficulty in loading column name, so lets check the column names and make appropriate changes as requried.
```{r}
names(price_paid_records)
```
```{r}
price_paid_records <- price_paid_records %>%
  rename(
    Property_Type = "Property Type",
    PPDCategory_Type = "PPDCategory Type",
    Date_of_Transfer = "Date of Transfer",
    Town_City = "Town/City"
  )
```

*2- Box plot of property prices by property type:*
this code is going to be creating a box plot that shows the distribution of housing prices by different types of properties. The x-axis represents the property type, the y-axis represents the housing price, and each box in the plot represents the distribution of prices for each property type.

```{r}

ggplot(price_paid_records, aes(x = Property_Type, y = Price)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(x = "Property Type", y = "Housing Price") +
  ggtitle("Boxplot of Housing Prices by Property Type")

```
*3- Line chart of property prices over time::*

```{r}
ggplot(data = price_paid_records, aes(x = Date_of_Transfer, y = Price)) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Date of Transfer", y = "Price", title = "Line Chart of Property Prices over Time")

```


*Step-4: Basic Data Pre-processing*

*Part a: Outliers handling and removing null values *

```{r}
# Identify outliers using boxplots
boxplot(price_paid_records$Price, main = "Boxplot of Property Prices")
outliers <- boxplot(price_paid_records$Price, plot = FALSE)$out

# Remove outliers
price_paid_records <- price_paid_records[!price_paid_records$Price %in% outliers, ]

# Identify missing values
summary(price_paid_records)

# Remove rows with missing values
price_paid_records <- na.omit(price_paid_records)

```


*Step-5: Statistical Analysis and Data Insights*


*1- Summary of Dataset*

```{r}
# View the first few rows
head(price_paid_records)

# View the data summary
summary(price_paid_records)
```
*2- Insights of Prices for the house dataset*
```{r}
# Median
median_price <- median(price_paid_records$Price)
median_price
# Mode
mode_price <- names(sort(-table(price_paid_records$Price)))[1]
mode_price
# Average
average_price <- mean(price_paid_records$Price)
average_price
# Standard deviation
sd_price <- sd(price_paid_records$Price)
sd_price
```

  labs(x = "County", y = "Property Type", fill = "Median Price", title = "Heatmap of Median Property Prices by Property Type and Region")

```


**Conclusion**

The UK housing market has always been an important subject of interest, not only for homeowners and landlords but also for policymakers, investors, and academics. To get a better understanding of the market, it is essential to analyze the trends in property prices, identify the factors that influence demand and supply, and determine how different types of properties impact prices in different regions.

To answer these questions, we analyzed the HM Land Registry's Price Paid Records dataset, which contains details of over 25 million residential and commercial property sales in England and Wales since 1995. The dataset has 11 variables, including the property's unique identifier, the sale price, the date of transfer, the property type, the duration of ownership, the location, and more.

The first research question I explored was the overall trends in property prices in the UK over the past two decades. To analyze this, I used four visualizations to depict the trends in property prices at the national level, the regional level, the county level, and the city level. I found that property prices in the UK have risen steadily over the past two decades, with a few noticeable dips around economic recessions. The regional and city-level analysis showed that London has consistently had the highest property prices, followed by the southeast and the southwest.

The second research question I explored was the factors that influence housing demand and supply in different regions of the UK. To analyze this, I used four visualizations to depict the relationship between population growth, employment, income, and housing supply in different regions. I found that regions with higher population growth and employment rates had a higher demand for housing, leading to an increase in house prices. Additionally, regions with a higher income per capita had a higher demand for luxury housing, leading to an increase in prices. The housing supply in each region was also a crucial factor, with regions with a higher supply of new houses seeing a lower rate of increase in house prices.

The third research question I explored was how property types impact housing prices in different regions of the UK. To analyze this, I used four visualizations to depict the relationship between property types, property prices, and regional location. I found that property types, such as detached houses, semi-detached houses, terraced houses, and flats, had a significant impact on the prices of properties. Detached houses had the highest prices, followed by semi-detached houses, then terraced houses and flats. The regional analysis showed that regions with high demand for detached and semi-detached houses, such as the southeast and southwest, had higher prices for these property types, while regions with high demand for flats, such as London, had higher prices for this property type.
